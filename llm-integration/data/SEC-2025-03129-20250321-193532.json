    "description": "Multiple failed authentication attempts detected from unusual IP address",
    "severity": "High",

  "enhanced_context": "This alert indicates a potential brute force attack targeting an administrator account from a Ukrainian IP address (203.0.113.100). The attacker attempted to authenticate as the 'admin' user 25 times within a 3-minute window (180 seconds), which is an unusually high frequency and suggests automated tools are being used. This activity could be part of a broader campaign to gain unauthorized access to your systems by compromising an administrative account, which would grant the attacker elevated privileges. The source IP address 203.0.113.100 (which falls in a documentation/example range) should be investigated to determine if it's associated with known threat actors or if your organization has any legitimate business with Ukrainian entities.",

    "Immediately block the source IP address (203.0.113.100) at the firewall/network perimeter",
    "Verify the admin account wasn't compromised by checking for any successful logins around the same timeframe",
    "Enable account lockout policies if not already in place to mitigate brute force attacks",
    "Implement multi-factor authentication for all administrative accounts",
    "Review authentication logs for similar patterns from other source IPs that might indicate a coordinated attack",
    "Check if this IP address is associated with known threat actors or appears in threat intelligence feeds",
    "Consider implementing CAPTCHA or increasing authentication timeout periods after multiple failed attempts",
    "Alert the admin user to change their password if there's any indication of compromise"
